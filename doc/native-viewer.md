# Native viewer

EPUBLib renders reflowable EPUB with TextKit 2 behind the unchanged `EPUBReaderEngine` seam
([vocaro/EPUBLib#3](https://github.com/vocaro/EPUBLib/issues/3)). This document is the design
and the contract between its parts. Everything below lives in the `EPUBViewing` target under
`Sources/EPUBViewing/Native/` and is internal unless marked public.

## Pipeline

```

              EPUBCFI / SpineCFIs / TextSearch ◀── TextMap ◀────┘
              Position/                                          │
                                                                 ▼
            NativeSession (Session/) ──▶ ReaderCanvas (View/: UITextView / NSTextView, TextKit 2)
```

1. **Document** (`ContentDocument`). libxml2 parses each spine item into an element/text tree
   that matches what an EPUB CFI sees: comments and processing instructions dropped, adjacent
   text and CDATA merged. Named HTML entities become numeric references before an XML parse;
   markup that is not well-formed falls back to libxml2's HTML parser and is reported.
   `XMLSafety` refuses entity declarations first. No DTD or network access, depth and node limits.
2. **Style** (`StyleResolver`, `CSSStyleSheet`, `FontRegistry`). A bounded CSS parser and
   cascade over a user-agent stylesheet, the book's archive-local stylesheets and `style`
   attributes produce a `ComputedStyle` per element: the CSS subset in `ComputedStyle.swift`.
   `@font-face` fonts load from the archive with CoreText. Nothing remote is fetched.
3. **Text** (`SectionBuilder`). One walk of a section's DOM produces an `NSAttributedString`,
   a `TextMap` back to DOM positions, element anchors, note content and a `SectionReport`.
   Rich content (images, SVG, tables, MathML, rules) comes from a `RichContentFactory` as text
   attachments. A section's characters depend only on its document, never on typography.
4. **Positions** (`EPUBCFI`, `SpineCFIs`, `TextSearch`). Swift ports of foliate-js
   `epubcfi.js`, `search.js` and `text-walker.js` (MIT) over `ContentDocument`, producing and
   resolving the same CFIs foliate-js produced, and locating quotes with its matcher.
5. **Views** (`ReaderCanvas`, `ReaderCanvasView`). TextKit 2 text views: one real scroll view
   over the whole book for continuous scroll, and section pages sliced from one layout per
   column width for page turns.
6. **Session** (`NativeEngine`, `NativeSession`, `NativeBook`). The `EPUBReaderSession`:
   commands, events, capabilities, section building and caching, locations and bookmarks.

## Decisions

- **Engine identity and bookmarks.** `EPUBReader.identifier` is `org.epublib.reader` and its
  bookmarks are `epublib-cfi-v1` (`EPUBReader.bookmarkFormat`): names for the library, not a
  renderer, so they outlive any change of how pages are drawn. The value is an EPUB CFI in the
  form foliate-js produced (relocations carry the visible range's CFI, selections the
  selection's range CFI), generated and resolved by a port of its code. Bookmarks tagged with
  the WebKit reader's `org.epubreaderlib.foliate`/`epubcfi-v1` are refused as another engine's;
  nothing had shipped, so a host migrates its own stored ones by re-tagging them, since the CFI
  value names the same position. A CFI that no longer resolves (a changed book has a different
  publication ID and is rejected before that) produces a `.notice`.
- **Fixed layout.** Out of scope at first: neither StudyWright catalog (50 shipped EPUBs, 87
  PDFReflowLib conversions) contains a pre-paginated book. Fixed-layout spine items render as
  reflowable text with a `.disclosure`; capabilities are not reduced. Faithful rendering is
  tracked in [#5](https://github.com/vocaro/EPUBLib/issues/5).
- **Vertical writing.** TextKit 2 on iOS has no vertical layout. `writing-mode: vertical-*`
  renders horizontally, with a `.disclosure`. Ruby and right-to-left text are native.
- **MathML.** A native layout engine (CoreText) draws each `<math>` as an attachment,
  baseline-aligned inline and centred for `display="block"`. The corpus uses `mi`, `mn`, `mo`,
  `mrow`, `mfrac`, `msup`, `msub`, `msqrt` and `mstyle` (1,798 formulas, all with `alttext`);
  the engine also covers the common remainder. Anything it cannot lay out shows its `alttext`
  and is disclosed. No WebKit.
- **SVG.** Every inline SVG in the corpus wraps one `<image>` (covers and title pages); those
  render as that image with the SVG's sizing. Other SVG is shown where the platform image
  decoder supports it, else as its title or nothing, and is disclosed.
- **Tables.** Attachments drawn natively (TextKit 2 has no `NSTextTable` on iOS), one
  image-drawn attachment per row so pages can break between any two rows; rows a rowspan
  joins, and the header, keep with the next row and share a page when they fit. `colspan`/
  `rowspan` honoured (`rowspan="0"` spans one row, as WebKit does); a spanning cell is drawn in
  each row it covers. Tables too wide for the line shrink their text to 60%, then wrap by
  character. One-column tables, which books use as callout boxes, flow as ordinary text. Cell
  text is not selectable; it is searchable, and VoiceOver reads each row's cells.
- **Footnotes.** EPUB 3 `noteref` links show their note in a popover. Footnote `aside`s are
  hidden from the flow; endnotes stay in place and also show in popovers.
- **Continuous scroll** is whole-book: one `UITextView`/`NSTextView` over every linear
  section, so nothing resets at a section boundary and the system scroll edge effects apply.
  Until every section is built it shows the current section, then swaps to the whole book in
  place. Nonlinear sections stay out of it, as page turns step over them; navigating to one
  shows it on its own.
- **Building** is per section and lazy for first paint: the initial section builds first and
  the session emits `.ready` once it is on screen; the rest build in the background in
  parallel. Images decode lazily, downsampled to their displayed size, under a shared cache
  budget.
- **Highlights.** New public `EPUBReaderCommand.setHighlights([EPUBHighlight])` and capability
  `.highlights` draw host highlights from their range CFIs (StudyWright #85). Search and
  highlights are TextKit 2 rendering attributes; they never change the text.
- **Book pose.** New public `View.epubReaderDivision(_:)` reserves a vertical division in the
  reader's own coordinates. Columns never depend on device idiom, orientation or screen.

## Layout

All lengths are points. These follow foliate-js's paginator defaults, so books lay out much
as they did.

- **Columns.** Paginated flow uses two columns when the page is landscape (width > height)
  and its content width, 93% of the width, is more than 720 (about 775 pt wide); otherwise one.
  The outer horizontal margin is at least 3.5% of the width each side, columns are at most 720
  wide (the content area is centred when that caps it), the column gap is 7.53% of the content
  width (foliate's `g / (1 − g)` with g = 7%), and the top and bottom margins are 48.
- **Book pose.** With a vertical division the spread has two columns: the gutter is the
  division band plus half a gap each side, and both columns have the narrower side's width,
  aligned towards the fold. When that would be under 200 wide, and in continuous scroll, a
  single column uses the wider side.
- **Continuous scroll.** One column at most 720 wide, centred, with the same outer margin. On
  iOS the text view has `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior = .automatic`, `contentInset` top 48
  and bottom 64 on top of the live safe area, `textContainerInset` only horizontal, and
  `.soft` top and bottom edge effects; nothing is drawn. On macOS the scroll view uses AppKit's
  automatic content insets and the window toolbar's own edge effect.
- **Pages.** A section is laid out once per column size; pages are slices of that layout at
  line boundaries, never splitting a line, honouring `.readerPageBreakBefore` (CSS
  `break-before: page`) and keeping a `.readerKeepWithNext` paragraph with the next (never
  past the page's first line, and only when both fit on the next page). An attachment taller than a page gets a page of its own. A
  spread shows consecutive slices. Each column is a non-scrolling TextKit 2 text view holding
  only its page's text, so selection, VoiceOver and link interaction are native and stay on the
  page. A paragraph that continues onto the next page is laid out a few lines further (or to
  a line break) and clipped, so its lines break exactly as in the measuring layout; justified
  text takes more, because CoreText justifies a paragraph of up to 8,192 characters as a whole
  and a longer one line by line. Paginations are cached per section and column size; a resize,
  rotation or bar change repaginates once it ends, in steps when far into a section, with the
  old spread on screen until the new one is ready. A finished pagination keeps only its pages.
- **Right to left.** `page-progression-direction="rtl"` mirrors spreads, swipes and tap zones.

## Input and accessibility

- Paginated: a tap or click within 56 pt of either edge (except on a link, a press-and-hold or
  while text is selected), a horizontal swipe (not while text is selected), and on macOS a
  trackpad gesture or wheel tick turns a page. Continuous scroll scrolls natively.
- Keys (all flows): Left/Page Up previous, Right/Page Down/Space next, Shift-Space previous.
  In continuous scroll a page turn scrolls by one viewport less a line.
- VoiceOver: page-turn actions via `accessibilityScrollAction` and the named "Next Page" and
  "Previous Page" actions; text reads in order from the text views.
- Selection: native selection UI with the host's `EPUBSelectionAction` in the edit or context
  menu, no length cap. `.selectionChanged` settles 150 ms after the selection stops changing.

## Commands and events

| Command | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `nextPage` / `previousPage` | Page turn (paginated) or one viewport (scrolled); stops at the book's ends; skips nonlinear sections as foliate-js did. |
| `navigate(href:)` | An encoded spine or resource href with optional fragment; unknown or non-local hrefs throw `invalidCommand`. |
| `restore(location)` | Same publication, engine ID and `epublib-cfi-v1` format or `incompatibleLocation`; resolves the CFI and shows its start. |
| `locate(text, highlight)` | First match in reading order with foliate's matcher. `highlight` selects it natively (emitting `.selectionChanged` with the passage). A miss emits `.notice("the cited passage could not be found in this book")`. Clears search highlights. |
| `searchHighlight` / `clearSearch` | Draws every match across the book / removes them. |
| `style` | Font size 12–96, dark, flow. Size or appearance rebuilds the text; the position is kept across rebuilds and flow switches. |
| `setHighlights` | Replaces drawn host highlights. |

`.ready` is emitted once, when the first section is on screen in a mounted view. `.relocated`
carries the section href, overall progression (by section byte size, as foliate-js computed it),
the table-of-contents title for the position and the visible range's CFI. `.disclosure` text
summarises the books' `SectionReport`s and is re-emitted when it changes. `.notice` reports
refused external links, unresolved CFIs and quotes, and highlights that could not be drawn.

## Security

Books are untrusted. Nothing is executed: there is no JavaScript engine. Every reference
resolves inside the archive through `ResourceReference`; remote URLs are never fetched and are
counted for disclosure. XML, CSS and font input is bounded, and the import limits in
`EPUBReading` still apply. External links are refused with a notice.

## Qualification

The spike the issue asked for ran on the books StudyWright reads, with the opt-in
`NativeCorpusQualificationTests` (`EPUBLIB_CORPUS`): the 50 shipped catalog EPUBs (Standard
Ebooks, Project Gutenberg and government titles), the 87 PDFReflowLib conversions of the
review set, and, as a sample of imported EPUBs, 165 conversions of the same PDFs by two other
converters (72 of which EPUBReading opens; the rest reference resources missing from their
archives and are refused by the parser, as before).

- **Fidelity.** 213 books, 9,566 sections, 90 million rendered characters and 55,748
  attachments built with no crash, no withheld section and no text-map round-trip failure.
  All 1,798 formulas lay out natively (no `alttext` fallback); 19 sections of third-party
  conversions needed the forgiving HTML parser; 84 remote resource references in catalog
  books were refused. Computed styles were compared with WebKit's on 68,817 elements across
  the catalogs; after the reader's deliberate defaults, the remaining differences were centred
  figure captions and `ex` units.
- **CFI compatibility.** CFIs and search are checked against vectors recorded from foliate-js
  itself in WebKit: about 2,800 range-to-CFI conversions, 3,300 resolutions, spine bases,
  parse/print round trips and quote matches.
- **Time** (release build, Apple M5 Max, macOS 27; expect an iPhone to be several times
  slower). Opening a book: median 6 ms. Time to first paint is the first section's build:
  median 1.4 ms, 95th percentile 26 ms, worst 55 ms. Building every section in the background:
  median 8 ms, worst 183 ms. A 1 MB section shows its first page in about 8 ms and turns pages
  in about 1 ms; a 3.5 MB, 300-section book opens in continuous scroll in about 50 ms.
- **Memory.** A book's footprint is dominated by `EPUBReading`'s in-memory snapshot (its
  compressed and expanded bytes, unchanged by this work). Images are never decoded during a
  build; they decode downsampled when drawn, into a shared 96 MB cache that evicts least
  recently used and trims on memory pressure.

Go: the native viewer is the bundled engine.

## Limitations

- Fixed-layout books reflow ([#5](https://github.com/vocaro/EPUBLib/issues/5)); vertical writing
  renders horizontally (both disclosed).
- Floats and absolute positioning are not laid out: a floated attachment sets to its side, an
  out-of-flow box is skipped; `inline-block` is inline; percentages in margins and indents
  resolve against a nominal 600-pt column.
- Table cell text is not selectable and links inside cells do not activate; a single table row
  taller than a page (after shrinking to 60%) is clipped to the page, and a spanning cell's
  text can be cut at a page break between the rows it spans.
- MathML has no line breaking (wide formulas scale down), no `mglyph` or elementary-math
  elements, and English-only spoken readings when `alttext` is absent.
- Search in languages with tailored collation (Turkish, Swedish, Spanish…) finds a superset
  of foliate's matches. Documents WebKit would have re-read as HTML can yield CFIs that differ
  from foliate's in whitespace outside the body or where HTML tree construction reshapes markup.
- VoiceOver's line-by-line navigation inside a column may reach the clipped lines of a
  paragraph that continues on the next page.
- A selection stays within one column: in a two-column spread it cannot run from one column
  into the other (each column is its own text view), and `locate` selects the part of a passage
  on its first page while reporting the whole passage.
- The last lines of a justified paragraph over 8,192 characters may break differently from the
  measured page when the page starts inside the paragraph and also shows what follows it; the
  column then grows to show them rather than clip.
- In continuous scroll a selection can span sections, but its bookmark (a CFI, which names one
  content document) covers only the part in the first section.
- Flexbox and grid lay out as blocks: content a book centres vertically with `min-height` and
  flex alignment (Standard Ebooks epigraphs) starts at the top of the page.
